# Katas

A monorepo containing some of the Katas I've worked on - mostly shared as a learning tool for others - rather than being examples of perfect solves.

## What is a Kata?
[codekata](http://codekata.com/) describes Katas as:

> ...an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways. Some are open ended, and involve thinking about the issues behind programming.

Katas are often used as technical interview questions.
